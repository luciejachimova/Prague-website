              <p class="mb-3">
                Prague Castle has been an important symbol of the Czech state
                for more than a thousand years. It was founded in the 9th
                century and became the seat of Czech rulers and later
                presidents. The castle, one of the largest complexes in the
                world, is made up of historical palaces, offices, church and
                fortification buildings, gardens and picturesque spots. It
                covers an area of 45 hectares. The panoramic view of Prague
                Castle is one of the most spectacular in the world.

                This Gothic cathedral, the spiritual symbol of the Czech state,
                was founded in 1344 on the site of the original Romanesque
                rotunda. The construction took nearly 600 years and was finally
                completed in 1929. Its impressive interior is home to such
                wonders as the beautifully decorated St Wenceslas Chapel with
                the tomb of St Wenceslas, the crypt where Czech kings are
                buried, and the Crown Chamber, where the Crown Jewels are kept.

                Once an hour, the Vyšehrad district is filled with the sound of
                bells from the chapter church, which has undergone a number of
                modifications in the 950 years since it was built. In 1903, its
                construction was finally completed, giving the church its
                current neo-Gothic appearance. The interior is richly decorated
                with Art Nouveau ornamental and figural wall paintings. The
                church's treasury houses an exhibition of jewellery and rare
                textiles from the Vyšehrad Chapter.

              <p class="mb-3">
                Prague’s oldest bridge was built to replace the Judith Bridge
                that had been badly damaged by floods in 1342. Construction of
                the new bridge, originally called Stone Bridge or Prague Bridge,
                began in 1357 under the auspices of Charles IV and was finished
                in 1402. Since 1870 the bridge has been called Charles Bridge.
                It is built of sandstone blocks, flanked at each end by
                fortified towers (Lesser Town Bridge Towers, Old Town Bridge
                Tower). From 1683 to 1928, 30 statues of saints were carved to
                decorate the bridge, the most famous of which is the statue of
                St John of Nepomuk.

                The Old Town Hall was established in 1338 as the seat of the Old
                Town administration. The oldest part of the complex consists of
                the southern wing a beautiful Gothic tower with a bay chapel and
                a unique astronomical clock – known as the Orloj – where, every
                hour between 9 am and 11 pm, the twelve apostles appear. The
                Gothic Revival eastern wing of the Town Hall was destroyed
                during the Prague Uprising on May 8, 1945 and was never rebuilt.
                The visitor route includes the chapel, historical halls, the
                underground areas and the tower.

                Unquestionably the main landmark of the Žižkov district, at 216
                m in height, it's also the tallest building in the city. With a
                360° view, Prague is laid out before your eyes from the viewing
                platform at 93 m. One entire floor is dedicated to relaxation
                and above all to top quality gourmet experiences. The architects
                Václav Aulický and Jiří Kozák designed the tower in the 1980s.
                Ten giant sculptures of babies by leading Czech artist David
                Černý crawl all over the outside of the tower.

                The National Museum is the largest museum in the Czech Republic.
                It covers a range of disciplines and collecting fields from the
                natural sciences to specialized areas of the social sciences. It
                brings together collections of materials documenting the
                development of nature, and the history and prehistory of both
                Czech and foreign origins. The museum's exhibits are located in
                a number of buildings around Prague. The National Museum also
                organizes a range of cultural and educational programs.

                The memorial building on top of Vítkov Hill was built between
                the years 1928 and 1938 in honour of the Czechoslovak
                legionaries. The exhibition "The Crossroads of Czech and
                Czechoslovak Statehood" captures significant turning points in
                the history of the 20th century. The monument also features the
                Tomb of the Unknown Soldier, a monumental equestrian statue of
                Jan Žižka, and a café with a panoramic view of the city.

                Gate Tower, which formerly served as a gunpowder store, is still
                the starting point for the Coronation or Royal Route to Prague

                This pillar of modern architecture in Prague “danced” onto the
                Rašínovo Embankment in 1996. The project comes from the drawing
                board of world-renowned architects Vlado Milunić and Frank O.
                Gehry. Its concept was inspired by the dance skills of the
                famous film couple – the stone tower symbolizes Fred Astaire and
                the glass tower, his partner Ginger Rogers. A gallery and a
                restaurant with a terrace offering a 360° view of Prague can be
                visited in the Dancing House.

                The majestic royal castle has been towering over the Berounka
                river since the 14th century. It was initially the king’s
                country residence, but later became an unconquerable treasury,
                guarding the greatest valuables of the Holy Roman Empire. The
                castle’s truly unique feature are its sacral spaces – the Chapel
                of St Catherine, the Church of the Assumption and the stunning
                Chapel of the Holy Cross, home to the world’s largest collection
                of Gothic board paintings. The vistas from the castle onto the
                surrounding hills are also exquisite.
